# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
A Machine Learning regression project that predicts the quality of white wine (on a scale of 0-10) based on physicochemical tests like acidity, sugar, and pH levels.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values using the `missingno` library.
*   **EDA:** Visualized correlations and distributions using `Seaborn` & `Matplotlib`.
*   **Preprocessing:** Implemented `StandardScaler` to normalize feature values.
*   **Model:** Built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model with `Scikit-Learn`.
*   **Metric:** Achieved an $R^2$ score of **[INSERT YOUR SCORE HERE]**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   Python
*   Pandas & NumPy
*   Scikit-Learn
*   Seaborn & Matplotlib

## ⚙️ How to Run
